With 12+ years writing and releasing music and 7+ giving tutorials I would be happy to share my production knowledge, tips and tricks with you - predominately with Ableton but also fruity loops and logic. Whether you be an established artist or beginner I feel confident there's a lot I can share with you having sold and released thousands of records - writing music should be for all!

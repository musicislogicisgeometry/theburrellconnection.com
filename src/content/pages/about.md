Born in the fringes of 90’s Techno rife with nostalgia, emotion and memory. **The Burrell Connection** known by many as Zander, is the alignment of aliases for the east coast Scot now residing in Berlin, since early teens  a stalwart figure in the underground scene. His midwest US influences have cultivated a great understanding of dance-floor culture, as shown by numerous releases on labels such as Craigie Knowes, Tartelet Records, Optimo Espacio, Outer Zone and Pace Yourself.

You may have caught him perform live or DJ at the likes of Tresor, Sub Club, Warehouse Project, Griessmuehle or Renate over the years, otherwise mixes can be submerged through Refuge, HÖR and Red Light Radio. Linking a number of aliases aka **Alfie**, **Dream_E**, **DJ59** and 1/2 of **Highfield Casuals** - The Burrell Connection sound has been shaped over time and refined by a life well-lived. Both an ode to the past and a nod to the future.

Scotland born, Berlin based. The name stems from The Burrell Collection, an art space in the Southside of Glasgow. The very year when landing here (1995) the area itself faced potential demolition. It would later find itself preserved that summer by numerous campaigns and squats, becoming full on raves with protesters arriving from all over. Around the time of writing music in the Southside, was gifted a record at an after party produced by the Nu Groove legends Rhano and Rheji. Both a nod towards preservation and the discovery of art; a love for hidden gems both past and present; Connection was made, and **The Burrell Connection** brought to life.

Spinning vinyl since 15, a number of parties have been trown and performed. Moving to Glasgow to run and grow 2 clubs, he welcomed true legends of the underground including Moodymann, Helena Hauff, Charanjit Singh and Underground Resistance. A resident at La Cheetah Club and the after-hours spot Lunacy resulted in a proper graduation. Since 2015 he's landed a number of his own productions on vinyl. Labels include **Optimo Music** (RIP JD Twitch!), **Tartelet Records**, **Craigie Knowes** and **Tresor**.

2025 marked the release of 70+ tracks as **Dream_E, Alfie + DJ59** with The Burrell Connection pulling aliases together.Support has included everyone from the late great Andrew Weatherall, Eclair Fifi and Leftfield. Aliases span across a number of sub-genres, as can also be heard when performing a diverse catalogue. Firmly at the forefront stands Chicago house, Detroit techno, Belgian New Beat and club ready Dub. First schooled on the warmups, now brought to deliver the peak time closes and the 'Come Down With Me' afters running well into the next day. One for all ears!

On many occasions DJing out (recordings online from **Warehouse Project**, **Griessmuehle, Sub Club** and DIY raves) but regularly delivering the fully analog LIVE performances solely with hardware. Recently one of the recordings from performing live at Tresor made it to **TRUSHMIX**, **Resident Advisor 'Mix Of The Day'** and an excerpt signed to Tresor Records for release in 2025.

"Born in the fringes of 90’s Techno rife with nostalgia, emotion and memory. Known by many as Zander, an east coast Scot now residing in Berlin has since early teens been a stalwart figure in the underground scene. His midwest US influences have cultivated a great understanding of dance-floor culture, as shown by numerous releases on labels such as Craigie Knowes, Tartelet Records, Optimo Espacio, Outer Zone and Pace Yourself.

You may have caught him perform live or DJ at the likes of Tresor, Sub Club, Warehouse Project, Griessmuehle or Renate over the years, otherwise mixes can be submerged through Refuge, HÖR and Red Light Radio. Linking a number of aliases (Alfie, Dream_E, DJ59) The Burrell Connection sound has been shaped over time and refined by a life well-lived. Both an ode to the past and a nod to an independent and creative future." - Max (Craigie Knowes)

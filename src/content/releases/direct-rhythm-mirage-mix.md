  Worldwide Fundraiser Compilation by Refuge Worldwide</a></iframe>


  13,000+ radio shows but no officially released music? It was time we started a label to showcase the productions of the many, many talented artists around us. The Refuge Worldwide label will be a way to share the output of our music studio at Niemetzstraße, as well as some other special projects from our friends and partners.


  First up, a fundraising compilation to support the station, with music kindly donated by 28 Refuge residents. Just like the radio, there’s everything from ambient, R&B, jazz, and experimental to breaks and techno, with a few acapella skits thrown in there for the real radio feel. Thanks for listening!

description: >
  The Aquarium, a beloved dancefloor at Fandango, isnâ€™t confined to any specific
  genre but rather embodies an entire colourscape and aesthetic, guided by a 115
  BPM restriction. Some of the most thrilling ideas emerge from spaces of
  limitation, and it is here the Aquarium has found its much-celebrated groove.

description: From the Southside of Glasgow now the south side of Berlin,
  previously most notably The Burrell Connection, but also Alfie and DJ59,
  focusses on Dream_E. Kicking off the self-titled vinyl and digi imprint with a
  mix of Breaks, House & Techno, "Crushed" follows in hot pursuit of the
  acclaimed "Dreams On 22" Ambient / IDM album released last year on Pace
  Yourself and a number of releases via longtime fellow deejays, Craigie Knowes.
  A donation will be made to The Encephalitis Society following each release.

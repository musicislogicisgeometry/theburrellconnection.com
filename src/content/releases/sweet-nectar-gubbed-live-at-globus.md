  The term annex typically describes a structure joined to a main building,
  offering extra space or function. In this spirit, Tresor Records revives the
  ANNEX series with a new end-of-year collection that serves as an extension of
  the label and club’s output, adding to the creative life that has unfolded
  within Köpenicker Str. 70 over the past years.


  Since the club moved in 2007, the Kraftwerk complex has been repurposed from its original use as a power station to fulfil multiple functions that bring people together to collaborate and congregate: Office, venue, club, exhibition space, and home to the Berlin Atonal festival, the Tresor Foundation, and the Academy of Subcultural Understanding. With the arrival of the Hard Wax record shop in 2023, the building now offers another way for the like-minded to come together and to share ideas in a common space.


  ANNEX echoes the many roles of the building by fostering introduction, connection, and creation: all of the music within was created by individuals directly linked to Tresor: from club staff and residents to Hard Wax employees and long-time friends.


  The compilation unites artists from various backgrounds and generations, some collaborating for the first time, creating a moment in motion as Tresor heads into a new year.

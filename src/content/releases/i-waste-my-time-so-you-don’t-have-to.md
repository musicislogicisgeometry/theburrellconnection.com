  Craigie Knowes day-one affiliate The Burrell Connection rejoins the label for
  his much anticipated EP ‘I Waste My Time So You Don’t Have To’. Featuring the
  fantastic ‘E Before I’ which has been heard in various forms across Berlin’s
  underground in the past few months, accompanied by an additional version taken
  from The Burrell Connection’s recent LIVE performance in Tresor, invited by
  Wania's LNS & DJ Sotofett. The B-Side comes correct with the dubbed-out power
  of ‘Celestial’ alongside the quintessential Burrell Connection galaxy-spanning
  pads and bass combo on ‘Ensemble’. One for the real heads, from dub to club.

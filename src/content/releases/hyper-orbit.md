  Hyper / Orbit (Euro 12") - Craigie Knowes 2018


  "Smartly dubbed & tripped out Breakbeat House cuts" - Hardwax


  "The Burrell Connection is somewhat a resident with Craigie Knowes; he lived in the same flat in Glasgow with label boss Max when he started the label in 2015, he featured on the first release, he contributed to second fundraiser album, he's also played half of the parties at their Glasgow home, La Cheetah Club, and travelled with the Craigie Knowes DJ team to wow crowds around Europe.


  But enough of the history, this is now - The Burrell Connection's debut EP with the imprint, Hyper/Orbit. Hyperactive techno and breaks blended together, emotive pads, 808 basslines and that ever-creative and homage-paying sampling ability that The Burrell Connection's followers have come to love. It's Scotland's poster-boy at his finest. Diversity is the key to longevity."

  "Dubbed as one of Crack Magazine’s ‘5 New Acts You Need To Know’, Hay’s steady rise within the scene is backed up with a sterling four track EP on Glasgow imprint Craigie Knowes. Hyper/ Orbit thrusts us into an analog paradise."

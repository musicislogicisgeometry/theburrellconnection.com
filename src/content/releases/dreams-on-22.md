  Sincere, sarcastic and unassumingly seminal: Glasgow's answer to Basic
  Channel, Southside's answer to Pub and Sandy's answer to those endless afters.
  2s on the balcony and runs to the shop. An ode to the skyline; a symphony for
  the local legends; a tapestry of downtempo dreamscapes - from Shawlands to
  Neukölln and the world beyond. A warm dose of future-proof emotion. Strap in,
  this is one for heads, the lovers and all those along the way. Welcome to the
  layer cake son. Forever yours, Dream_E.


  My ‘Dream_E - Dreams on 22’ LP was written over the winters of 2018 + 2019 first in Glasgow (Shawlands), then in Berlin (Neukölln) and the tracks are in the order of how I wrote them, now moving around depending on how you hear them. I hope you enjoy the LP, especially in times of darkness, shout out to you all.
